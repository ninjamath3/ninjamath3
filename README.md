# Mathys – AI & Computer Vision Developer

Hi, I'm Mathys, an engineer specialized in computer sciences, computer vision and robotics. I build innovative solutions that combine real-time data processing, camera and robot monitoring, mobile app development, or AI solutions.

This repository acts as a portfolio of multiple independent projects.
Each folder represents a standalone project with its own README
explaining the context, approach, and technical choices.

This structure was chosen to centralize experimental and finished work.
