# Mathys – Generalist engineer specialized in robotics and computer vision 

Hi, I'm Mathys, a generalist engineer specialized in computer vision and robotics. I build innovative solutions that combine real-time data processing,
camera and robot monitoring, mobile app development, or AI solutions.

This repository acts as a portfolio of multiple independent projects.
Each folder represents a standalone project with its own README explaining the context, approach, and technical choices.

This structure was chosen to centralize experimental and finished work.

## Skills

* Programming: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, React Native, Expo, C, C++, HTML, CSS,
* Data prcessing: SQL, pandas, markdown, csv, json 
* AI & Machine Learning: Computer Vision, Neural Networks, 
* Mobile & Web Development: Full-stack apps, real-time data processing, geolocation services
* Tools & Platforms: Git, AsyncStorage, Firebase, Cloudflare, Ros2, Figma, Piskel, Vscode
